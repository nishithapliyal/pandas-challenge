Summary of Analysis
---------------------------------------

The data looks at student scores for math and reading across 15 schools in the same district. Using the average math and reading scores for students, the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects were calculated across the whole district, by school, grade, how much funding the school gets, how big the school is (in terms of student population), and type of school (district vs charter).  

Conclusions and comparisons
---------------------------------------
1. The charter schools in this set of schools performed better than district schools using the comparison metrics of average math and reading scores, along with having higher percentages of students that passed math and reading. For example, charter schools have an overall passing rate of ~90.43% whereas district schools are at ~53.67%. It is important to note that this conclusion is drawn solely from the students' performances in math and reading, there may be other subjects that influence the students' performance.
2.  Small and medium sized schools in this set of schools performed better than large schools with regards to the percentage of students passing math and reading. For example, the overall passing rate for small and medium schools are at ~89.88% and ~90.62%, respectively, whereas large schools have an overall passing rate of ~58.23%.
3.  Schools in this dataset with lower budgets per students performed better than schools with higher budgets. Schools with budgets lower than $585 per students have an overall passing rate of ~90.37%. Whereas, schools in the highest budget bracket ($645-680) have an overall passing rate of ~53.53%.
